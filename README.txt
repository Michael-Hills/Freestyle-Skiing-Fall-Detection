The code is split into two parts. The preprocessing and neural networks.

The preprocessing (including conversion of time series data) is contained within the python files:

- preprocessing.py 
- visualisation.py

And are executed through main.py. However please note, the preprocessing and visualisation has already been executed and the data has been saved.

DO NOT RUN these files again as the preprocessing has already been executed


The neural networks are contained within the .ipynb files of the network's respective name. i.e.:

- AlexNet.ipynb
- ResNet50.ipynb
- LSTM.ipynb
- CNNLSTM.ipynb

To execute these, simply run all cells within the notebook.

Please note they may take a long time to run.
